### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building scalable, high-performance web applications using Angular and React.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning improving my skills with modern JavaScript frameworks, and diving deeper into TypeScript, Redux, and state management patterns.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting open-source projects, or building user-centric and responsive UI with cutting-edge web technologies.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced performance optimization techniques, and ways to improve my CI/CD pipeline in front-end development.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building dynamic, component-based architectures, UI/UX best practices, or creating maintainable and scalable front-end code.

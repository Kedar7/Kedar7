### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Kedar7/Kedar7** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on building scalable, high-performance web applications using Angular and React.
🌱 I’m currently learning improving my skills with modern JavaScript frameworks, and diving deeper into TypeScript, Redux, and state management patterns.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting open-source projects, or building user-centric and responsive UI with cutting-edge web technologies.
🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced performance optimization techniques, and ways to improve my CI/CD pipeline in front-end development.
💬 Ask me about building dynamic, component-based architectures, UI/UX best practices, or creating maintainable and scalable front-end code.
